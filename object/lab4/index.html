            <div class="description">
                <h4>Wiring of the Circuit</h4>
                <p>I wired up this circuit so that the code can read the change in potentiometer from the analog pin, and then output to the correct LEDs accordingly using digital pins.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="description">
                <h4>"In our case, our  x is the analog input reading which ranges from [0, 1023], but what 
                    should be the range of  y? 
                    And how can we use the mapped value of y to turn on a different number of LEDs?"</h4>
                <p>I made the range of y be between 0 and 5 so that the x analog input could map to 0 (no LEDs), 1 (one LED), 2 (two LEDs), 3 (three LEDs), 4 (four LEDs), and 5 (five LEDs). I then wrote in the code that if y is greater than 0, as long as i (initially i = 0) is less than y then that number of LED (in the array) should turn on.</p>

                    <p>The x and y values of the joystick when it is at the center are about 510. Bringing the joystick to the left, the x value is 0 and the y value is 510.

            <h3> Part 5: Light Basic LED Whack-A-Mole </h3>

                    <div class="description">
                        <h4> Playing Whack-A-Mole </h4>
                        <p>I set up this code so that I would establish that all of the LEDs are off from the beginning. I called randomSeed(), which I used in Lab 2, in order to make randomly selecting an LED truly random. Then I read the x and y inputs, made sure the LEDs were off before starting again, and then sent out a player message as well as an LED count down. I ended up not using map() becuase I was having some issues with it and decided to stick with the original values I was reading from the joystick. In order to have 20 rounds, I had a for loop go for 20 times. Then, while the mole wasn't caught, I checked if the joystick value and the LED randomly chosen aligned. If they did, caught equals true and the player is out of the while loop. The LED turns off, and they start the for loop over again. Once the for loop has repeated 20 times, I used code that I used in lab 2 in order to read the time it took, I printed the player's time, and then the game restarts with the welcome message!</p>

        <h3> Reflection </h3>
        <p id="Reflection"> I struggled a bit because some of the ways I used if statements and for loops in one part of this lab didn't work in other sections. However, I really enjoyed the challenge of this lab as I felt it was approachable and challenging enough to be really interesting! </p>
