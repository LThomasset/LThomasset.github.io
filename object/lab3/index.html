                <ul>
                    <li> Temperature: Keep the iron between 600°F – 700°F. </li>
                    <li> Handling: Hold the iron by the handle only; never touch the metal parts. </li>
                    <li> Storage: Always return the iron to its stand when not in use. </li>
                    <li> Fumes: Turn on the fume extractor to avoid inhaling harmful smoke. </li>
                    <li> Protection: Wear safety glasses to protect your eyes from splatters. </li>
                    <li> Hygiene: No eating or drinking nearby, and wash your hands with soap when finished. </li>

                <h4> "Which type of wire (stranded or solid-core) did you find easier to solder to the protoboard?" </h4>
                <p> The solid-core wire was easier to solder to the protoboard because it was easier to keep still, and it was easier to mostly cover in solder. I think that was also partially because I stripped a little more off of the end of the stranded wire than the solid-core wire, so the stranded wire had more exposed wire that I had to try to cover with solder. </p>

                    <h4>Bridges</h4>
                    <p> I found this to be a bit difficult because the solder frequently wouldn't stay in the shape I wanted it to stay in. The instructions in the lab description to put the solder on adjacent pins before completing the bridge was super helpful. </p>

                    <p> I put the wires upright, put a little bit of solder on each side (that I'm going to connect together), then I heated up the solder once I arranged the wires so that they would create a longer wire. </p>

        <h3> Reflection </h3>
        <p id="Reflection"> The last time I soldered was in middle school, so I had a lot of fun getting a better understanding about how the process works! Definitely was a bit of a learning curve, but ended up being very approachable. </p>
